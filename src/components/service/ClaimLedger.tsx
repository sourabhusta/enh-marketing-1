 *  WHY THIS AND NOT A LIST OF CARDS. Both pages using this had it as a card
 *  grid first, and a card grid is what you build when you have not looked at
 *  what the items contain. On neither page are the six items six sentences of
 *  the same kind: some name four things each, one is a number, one is a
 *  refusal, one has no second sentence at all. Six identical boxes throw all of
 *  that away and spend a lot of vertical space doing it.
 *
 *  So the claim sits on the left and the evidence on the right, in whatever
 *  form the document gives it. Where a document offers nothing beyond the
 *  claim, the right side stays empty rather than being padded, and the claim
 *  takes the full width — which is its own signal, and reads as a flat
 *  statement rather than a hole.
 *
 *  THE REFUSAL GETS PULLED OUT. Both documents end on something they will not
 *  do: report followers, or rebuild a page that was never the problem. Set as
 *  row six of six it reads as an afterthought, when it is actually the line
 *  that decides whether a reader trusts the other five. `accentAt` lifts that
 *  row out of the ledger and gives it the panel it earns.
 *
 *  Every string is the calling document's. Figures are printed, never counted
 *  up: the site's Counter starts at zero and animates, so a frame where the
 *  animation has not run would show "0 years in the UAE market". A factual
 *  claim should never be briefly wrong for effect. */
