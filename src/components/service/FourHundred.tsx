/** The hero visual: four hundred issues, and the three that matter.
 *
 *  WHY THIS. It is the document's opening sentence, at its own numbers: "Most
 *  audits arrive as a 60-page PDF exported from a tool, with 400 issues listed
 *  and no indication which three matter." So the grid holds exactly 400 marks —
 *  16 across, 25 down — and three of them light. The count is the figure, which
 *  is why no numeral is printed and the hero stays wordless like every other one
 *  on this site.
 *
 *  WHY IT IS NOT DECORATION. Every mark stands for something the document
 *  names, and the whole point of the drawing is the ratio between 400 and 3 —
 *  which is legible at a glance and impossible to state as well in prose. That
 *  is the test an earlier hero on the on-page page failed: grey bars standing
 *  for nothing in particular, carrying no number and no meaning.
 *
 *  WHICH THREE is arbitrary and has to be: the document does not say which
 *  issues matter on anyone's site, only that a real audit tells you. They are
 *  fixed rather than random so the server and the browser agree.
 *
 *  Motion is opacity, colour and scale. No positioning. */
