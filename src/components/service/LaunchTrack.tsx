/** Six stages as a pinned horizontal journey that crosses a launch line.
 *
 *  WHY THIS SHAPE. The stages were a four-up grid, then a brand band, then a
 *  full-width card: three stacked blocks that gave a sequence no direction. A
 *  process is travelled, so the section now holds while the track moves
 *  sideways and every stage gets a full stage of its own instead of a quarter
 *  of a grid row.
 *
 *  WHAT THE CONTENT ADDS TO THE MECHANIC. A flat run of six equal cards would
 *  just be the channel rail from the Performance Marketing page again. This
 *  journey has a threshold in it. Four stages happen before anything is
 *  switched on; the fifth is the switching on ("introduced in stages where
 *  necessary. Your team reviews the output before the process is fully
 *  activated"); the sixth has no end at all ("After launch, we monitor the
 *  automation and make agreed adjustments as the process or connected systems
 *  change"). So the fifth card is the only one carrying brand, the progress
 *  rail beneath has a marked point where the automation goes live, and the
 *  track runs off into dashes past the last card rather than stopping.
 *
 *  IMPLEMENTATION FOLLOWS ChannelScroller, the one pinned horizontal run
 *  already proven in this codebase, and keeps its hard-won details on purpose:
 *  the pin is gated to widths with room and to readers who want motion; the
 *  native scroller only gives up its own overflow once the pin is really
 *  installed; travel is measured from the last card so it lands centred rather
 *  than from a guessed width; and the per-frame focus pass writes straight to
 *  style, because gsap's "scale" quickSetter silently no-ops without a primed
 *  transform cache.
 *
 *  THE FALLBACK IS THE FEATURE. Below lg, and for anyone on reduced motion,
 *  nothing pins: the track stays a native scroll-snap rail, which is the better
 *  interaction on a touch screen anyway. Nothing is hidden in either mode, so
 *  if the pin never installs the section is still a readable set of six cards. */
