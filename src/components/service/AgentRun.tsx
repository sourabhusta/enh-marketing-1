/** The hero visual: one run of an agent, drawn as the mechanism the document
 *  describes rather than as a picture of a robot.
 *
 *  WHY THIS SHAPE. The document's own sentence for AI Agents is already a
 *  machine: an agent "can receive information, check it against approved rules,
 *  retrieve data, update systems and pass the work to a person when approval or
 *  judgement is required". That is five actions, two dependencies and one
 *  condition, so it is a graph, not a queue. The previous visual drew a list
 *  clearing top to bottom with one gate in it, which showed the boundary but
 *  said nothing about how anything got decided. This draws the deciding:
 *
 *    work arrives  ->  the agent  ->  it completes, or a person is asked
 *                       ^     ^
 *                   rules     systems
 *
 *  The two flanks are the sentence's two dependencies, and they are the reason
 *  this reads as automation rather than as a flowchart: the core does not just
 *  pass work along, it consults something on either side before it routes.
 *
 *  THE CONDITION IS SHOWN AS A CONDITION. Most runs complete; every third one
 *  is handed to a person. That alternation exists so the branch can be seen at
 *  all, and no proportion is claimed by it: the document states no figure for
 *  how often judgement is required, and neither does this. The same editorial
 *  call, made the same way, as the single gate in the visual it replaces.
 *
 *  COLOUR CARRIES ONE MEANING. Brand marks the agent, the live signal and the
 *  person, and nothing else. The machine's own parts, the intake, the rules and
 *  the systems, resolve to snow as they clear. The first cut lit every part in
 *  brand, which looked busy and said nothing: if everything is emphasised then
 *  the handover, which is the page's actual argument, is not.
 *
 *  NOT ONE WORD OF TEXT, AND NO FAKE DATA. The person is an abstract mark, the
 *  rules are unlabelled ticks and the systems are unlabelled chips. Inventing
 *  plausible-looking invoice rows or rule names would be inventing client data.
 *
 *  HOW IT MOVES, AND WHY IT IS BUILT THIS WAY. Position is never animated. Two
 *  earlier hero visuals on this site broke because they animated transforms
 *  whose units did not mean what they looked like inside a scaled viewBox, so
 *  the travelling signal is a dash running along each edge instead: the paths
 *  carry pathLength="100", which makes the dash a percentage of the edge and
 *  removes the measuring step entirely. Everything else is opacity.
 *
 *  All of it is CSS, driven by one interval that advances the run and re-keys
 *  the animated layer. That is deliberate: CSS animations run whether or not
 *  the main thread is busy, they cost nothing when the tab is hidden, and each
 *  one's final keyframe is the finished picture, so a browser that never
 *  animates still renders something whole. See globals.css, "Agent run". */
