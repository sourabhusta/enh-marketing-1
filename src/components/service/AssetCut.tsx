/** The hero visual: one piece of footage, cut for several placements.
 *
 *  WHY THIS. The document says the conversation stalls on "whether the business
 *  has a video worth putting money behind", and answers it twice: existing
 *  material "can often be adapted", and the work includes "versions cut for
 *  different lengths and placements". So the drawing is one source asset and the
 *  cuts taken out of it — including a vertical one, because Shorts creative "can
 *  be cut from longer assets".
 *
 *  The cuts are different lengths because the document says lengths differ, and
 *  no cut is labelled with a duration: it names six seconds for bumpers and the
 *  first five seconds for skippable, but tying either to a specific bar here
 *  would be drawing a spec the source states in prose.
 *
 *  NOT ONE WORD OF TEXT. Motion is opacity and scaleX only — no positioning,
 *  which is where two earlier hero visuals on this site went silently wrong.
 *
 *  Under reduced motion every cut renders taken. */
