/** The five checks, as five reads on one process.
 *
 *  WHY THIS. They were five bordered rows, which is the arrangement that makes
 *  them look like a feature list. They are not a list. Read them together and
 *  every one is looking at a different feature of the same diagram:
 *
 *    "The steps your team currently follows"        -> the stages
 *    "The people and systems involved"              -> the handoffs between them
 *    "The time spent on each stage"                 -> how long each one takes
 *    "Repeated work and manual data entry"          -> where it loops back
 *    "Rules, exceptions and approval requirements"  -> where it stops for a person
 *
 *  The document calls the deliverable "process mapping", so the section draws
 *  the process once and makes each check a lens onto it. Taking a lens dims
 *  everything the other four look at, which is what reading a process map
 *  actually feels like.
 *
 *  THE DRAWING IS LAID OUT IN BANDS, one per lens, so each read has somewhere
 *  of its own to happen: the person sits above, the loop arcs over the spine,
 *  the stages run through the middle, and the duration is measured underneath.
 *  A short drawing had them all fighting for the same forty pixels.
 *
 *  NO INVENTED DATA. There are no stage names, no system names and no
 *  durations, because the document supplies none and the answer depends on the
 *  reader's own process. The schematic is a shape, not a record. The words
 *  beside it are the client's, at readable size, which is the opposite of the
 *  failure mode where a drawing carries the meaning and the copy shrinks to a
 *  caption. */

   *
   *  - Choosing a read takes control for good. Moving it on three seconds
   *    later, after someone deliberately picked one, is hostile.
   *  - Pointer over the block, or focus inside it, pauses. Reading and having
   *    the thing you are reading replaced are incompatible.
   *  - prefers-reduced-motion disables it outright. Content that changes by
   *    itself is motion, whatever it is made of.
   *  - The explicit control can stop and restart it. WCAG 2.2.2 wants a
