/** The hero visual: one tile in a package, and then the same channel given a
 *  frame of its own.
 *
 *  WHY THIS. It is the document's opening sentence, almost literally: "Most
 *  agencies here sell LinkedIn as one tile in a social media package. It gets
 *  the same treatment as Instagram, and it produces about as much B2B pipeline
 *  as you would expect from that." So the loop shows six identical tiles — no
 *  one of them distinguishable, which is the complaint — and then replaces the
 *  whole grid with a single panel that has actual structure inside it. The
 *  before and after are the argument.
 *
 *  WHY TWO LAYERS RATHER THAN AN EXPANDING TILE. Growing one tile out of a grid
 *  means animating its position toward the centre, and coordinate maths in a
 *  looping hero is where two earlier visuals on this site broke silently. A
 *  grid that recedes and a panel that arrives over it says the same thing with
 *  nothing but opacity and scale, which cannot be subtly wrong.
 *
 *  NOT ONE WORD OF TEXT, and no platform marks. Naming or badging the other
 *  five tiles would put competitors' brands in the hero to make a point the
 *  copy already makes; blank tiles make it better, because the complaint is
 *  precisely that they are treated as interchangeable.
 *
 *  Under reduced motion the resolved state renders: the grid receded, the
 *  panel present. */
