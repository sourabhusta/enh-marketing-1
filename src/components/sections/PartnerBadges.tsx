/** The issued partner and certification badges.
 *
 *  WHAT MOVES, AND WHAT DOES NOT. Google's and Meta's badge guidelines forbid
 *  distorting, recolouring or animating the mark, so nothing here touches the
 *  artwork: no scale, no rotation, no filter, no opacity on the image. The
 *  motion belongs entirely to the plate underneath — it rises and fades in on a
 *  stagger, and lifts a little under the pointer. The badge is carried by that
 *  plate, never animated itself.
 *
 *  WHY WHITE PLATES. All four marks ship with a white background of their own:
 *  two are round discs, one is a bordered card, one is a flat JPG. Dropped
 *  straight onto the near-black section they would read as four different white
 *  shapes at four different sizes. A common plate gives them one height, one
 *  corner radius and one measure of clear space, which is what makes them read
 *  as a row of credentials rather than as pasted-in images — and it is the
 *  compliant way to carry the full-colour marks on a dark page.
 *
 *  The plate is pure white rather than the site's `snow`, and that is on
 *  purpose twice over. `snow` inverts to near-black under `html.light`, which
 *  would put these marks on a black tile in light mode. And three of the four
 *  files carry pure white baked in with no transparency, so any off-white plate
 *  would show a visible seam where the artwork's own background meets it.
 *
 *  WHY THE PLATE IS NOT A FIXED WIDTH. Two badges are square and two are
 *  landscape. One box for all four would either shrink the wordmarks to the
 *  circles' width or strand the circles in a wide plate with air on both sides.
 *  Fixing the height and letting the width follow keeps every mark at the same
 *  optical size, which is the thing the eye actually reads.
 *
 *  Renders nothing when handed an empty list, so the row is never left with
 *  broken images. See public/badges/README.md. */
